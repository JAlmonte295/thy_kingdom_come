## Description

***Thy Kingdom Come*** is a resource-management strategy game where you take on the role of a king who is preparing for a looming invasion. With only 7 days to prepare, every decision matters. Will you raise a mighty army, fortify your walls, or ensure your people are prosperous and happy? The fate of your kingdom is in your hands.

This project was inspired by a love for resource-management board games and choose-your-own-adventure stories, where every choice has a meaningful consequence on the outcome.

## How to Play

*   **Goal:** Survive 7 days and build a **Power Level (Military + Structure)** of at least 100 to defeat the enemy.
*   **Actions:** Each day has three phases (Morning, Afternoon, and Evening). You can perform **one action** per phase.
*   **Resources:** Manage your **Treasury** to fund actions. Keep **Popularity** high to avoid a revolt. Balance **Food** and **Culture** to keep your people happy and even gain a popularity bonus.
*   **Losing:** You can lose in two ways: having your Power Level be too low at the end of 7 days, or if your Popularity drops to zero at any point.
